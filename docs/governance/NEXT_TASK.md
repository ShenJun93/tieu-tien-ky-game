## Current authority

`TASK-TIEU-TIEN-KY-PRODUCT-PROOF-SLICE-006-STORM-CONTROL-HERO-VFX` is closed. Its final
state:

- merged via PR #30 at `5cf00fc30be79d2ff4235dc33ec3b046b52ee652` (`main`), under the
  Director's standing delegated-merge authorization;
- new bespoke 5-beat composed VFX (ignition → water ripple → lightning → shock ring →
  residual) for exactly one skill, Storm Control — the shared `PrimitiveBurstVFX.cs`
  used by every other skill call site stayed untouched, as scoped;
- technical gate GREEN: `unity_compile`/`editmode` (167/167)/`playmode` (29/31, 2
  pre-existing skips)/`android_build` all PASS;
- `device_storm_control_render_check`: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED_RISK** — no clean on-device
  beat-sequence capture was ever obtained (live `adb` automation repeatedly died/
  disconnected); transparently disclosed, not fabricated as `PASS`;
- `human_playtest`: **RECORDED** — the Director confirmed a genuine live trigger was
  observed, but could not give a clean per-question answer to the task's 5 exact
  questions, because the surrounding scene is still primitive greybox geometry for
  every NPC and environment element, confounding VFX-specific judgment from general
  scene-fidelity judgment. Verbatim record and per-question mapping (gaps preserved,
  not guessed) in `docs/evidence/PRODUCT_PROOF_SLICE_006_STORM_CONTROL_HERO_VFX_REPORT.md`;
- `verdict: PASS_WITH_REMEDIATION` — technical gate GREEN; product gate genuinely
  confounded, not cleanly achieved or cleanly failed.

## Why this is a real pivot, not another VFX iteration

Slices 002-006 tried, in order: parameter tuning, technique escalation (real
`ParticleSystem`), material escalation (textured/alpha shader), and composition/
sequencing (this slice's bespoke 5-beat effect) — every axis this project's own
free/zero-cost VFX iteration could reach on the *effect itself*. This slice's Human
Gate surfaced a different, more fundamental diagnosis directly from the Director: the
"feels like a demo" complaint was never cleanly separable from VFX quality alone,
because every NPC and every piece of environment geometry is still an untextured
colored primitive (the `P0A_Greybox` scene, intentionally, for the Product Proof
phase). A well-authored VFX effect surrounded by flat colored boxes is still hard to
judge in isolation.

The Director has explicitly redirected priority: **no further per-skill VFX slice is
authorized by this closure.** The next decision is real art direction for NPCs and
environment — not another VFX technique/material/composition pass. The Director also
flagged that 2D texture-asset generation via ChatGPT Web is now demonstrated at
effectively zero cost (per this exact slice's 4 source textures), which changes the
cost calculus that originally justified staying in greybox — but full 3D character
models/rigging/animation remain a materially different, harder problem ChatGPT Web
image generation cannot produce directly. This distinction has not yet been resolved
into a bounded implementation task.

There is no active write task, branch authority, baseline, task/evidence pointer, or
writable path.

Any dependency audit/removal, rights/provenance review, art-direction authorization,
Product Proof continuation, gameplay/runtime/Unity/networking/PvP/co-op/Stage C/
backend/package mutation, or other successor work requires a fresh explicit
Human/Game Director decision and valid authority transition — in this case, most
likely a ChatGPT Web design-collaboration round (per
`docs/tasks/CHATGPT_WEB_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`) on NPC/environment art direction
and scope, before any `IMPLEMENT` task is activated.

Stop condition: `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED_BEFORE_SUCCESSOR_AUTHORITY`.
